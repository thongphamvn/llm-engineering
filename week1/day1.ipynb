Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

      "Về mặt pháp lý, Luật Công nghiệp công nghệ số số 71/2025/QH15 ngày 14/06/2025 đã đưa khái niệm tài sản số vào khuôn khổ định nghĩa và quản lý; Nghị quyết số 05/2025/NQ-CP ngày 09/09/2025 về triển khai thí điểm thị trường tài sản mã hóa trở thành bước ngoặt thể chế theo đúng nghĩa “mở cửa có kiểm soát”; đến ngày 10/12/2025, Bộ trưởng Bộ Tài chính quyết định thành lập Ban Quản lý thị trường giao dịch tài sản mã hóa, vừa đánh dấu bước tiến lớn, vừa là bước đi kịp thời để phù hợp với xu thế và yêu cầu quản lý hiện nay.\n",
